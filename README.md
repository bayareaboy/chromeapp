# chromeapp
This is a simple Google Chrome Extension that fetches product information from Shein.com

To get started:
1. Dowload the files or clone the repository
2. Run 'npm install' inside root directory
3. Run 'npm run dev'
4. Open 'localhost:3000' and you will see a chrome extension. From there simply add any product link from shein.com, and the app sends you back data in json format. Once you signup for shopify, you can simply send the json data to add products.
5. Let me know if you have any questions.
